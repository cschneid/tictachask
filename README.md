Simple TicTacToe Implementation


Learning
----------

The only reason I wrote this was to learn and refine some haskell code.  
It's very simple, and hopefully straightforward.  I attempted to look into 
making each method clear/easy to read, but I of course failed. I'm no 
haskell expert currently.  This is a learning exercise.
